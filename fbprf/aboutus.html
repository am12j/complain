        <p>
            This web application is intended to help people resolve infrastructure-related 
            problems in their community. Whether it is a broken road, electricity failure, 
            or water supply issues, citizens can easily submit their complaints here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to bridge the gap between citizens and authorities to ensure 
            a safer and better-maintained city for everyone.
